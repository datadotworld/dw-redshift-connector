* issue: support optional schema
* give each catalog a name that contains the dataset id
* read the selectors in the catalog config file (so rows can be deleted)
* need neutral command that determines if fetch-all or incremental (maybe)
* build 2 catalogs, one for full syncs, one for incrementals
* push error messages to admin dataset
